    <h3>My hero is Alphonso Davies. Born in a refugee camp in Ghana, Alphonso was born and brought up in Edmonton, Canada. Despite having such a rough start to his life, Alphonso worked hard to become a professional soccer player who starts for one of the best teams in the world. Since he is a refugee himself, he supports charties and gives back to others who are struggling with a situation he was once in. Alphonso is an inspirational young man who is an idol to many children throughout the world.</h3>
